    <h1>Molex Tool Suite: End User Tool</h1>
    <p>The App provides office workers personalised light control of work spaces in a building. Workers have dynamic light-scenes choices to support work tasks, mood and well-being. Light-scene availability varies in a building to enable task-specific lighting.</p>

      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>To lead user research and define user experiences, visual design (branding) and light experiences for workers. I conducted user trials to test new light authoring concepts and tools and communicated ideas in design documents and presentations for the client. The app is currently installed in Chicago. The success of the project has led to more work and user tool development.</p>
